# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analysis of people's interest in livestreams of published video games

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Are popular published video games also popular livestream formats?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The initial main question sounds trivial because it would be possible to think that the popularity of a video game also leads to an increase in the popularity of livestreams. But is that really the case?

In this data science project, the data sets mentioned below are used to find out whether after video games are released, the popularity of livestreams increases accordingly. For this purpose, data from Twitch is used to record the popularity of livestreams as well as data on successful video games in order to expand the data from Twitch with information on the corresponding video games.

The result of this project should answer the main question. In addition, this project will show possible reasons for the result, if these can be inferred from the corresponding underlying data.
