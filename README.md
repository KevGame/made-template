## Project Work

During the process of the project work, a Data Science project was independently conceived and executed, utilizing two open data sources. The project involved working with the data and presenting the results in a concluding project report. All the outcomes of the project work can be found in the `project` folder.

In the specific project, the focus was on analyzing interest in livestreams of popular video games, with the research question centered around whether popular video games are also popular livestream formats. Data from Twitch ([Data Source 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rankirsh/evolution-of-top-games-on-twitch)) was used to analyze the streaming market, while data from popular games ([Data Source 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matheusfonsecachaves/popular-video-games)) provided insights into the gaming market and extended the Twitch data.

As a result, a concluding project report was created, which can be read [here](https://github.com/KevGame/made-template/blob/main/project/report.ipynb) if interested. The corresponding presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/KevGame/made-template/blob/main/project/presentation-video.mp4), with the relevant [slides](https://github.com/KevGame/made-template/blob/main/project/slides.pdf).

## Exercises

In addition to the project work, various exercises related to data engineering had to be solved using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee). The solved exercises, along with additional information, can be found in the `exercises` folder.

## Context

All results in this repository were created as part of the lecture [Methods of Advanced Data Engineering](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/made/), offered by the [Professorship of Open-Source Software](https://oss.cs.fau.de/) at FAU.
