## Exercises
During the semester you will need to complete exercises, sometimes using [Python](https://www.python.org/), sometimes using [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee). You **must** place your submission in the `exercises` folder in your repository and name them according to their number from one to five: `exercise<number from 1-5>.<jv or py>`.

In regular intervalls, exercises will be given as homework to complete during the semester. We will divide you into two groups, one completing an exercise in Jayvee, the other in Python, switching each exercise. Details and deadlines will be discussed in the lecture, also see the [course schedule](https://made.uni1.de/). At the end of the semester, you will therefore have the following files in your repository:

1. `./exercises/exercise1.jv` or `./exercises/exercise1.py`
2. `./exercises/exercise2.jv` or `./exercises/exercise2.py`
3. `./exercises/exercise3.jv` or `./exercises/exercise3.py`
4. `./exercises/exercise4.jv` or `./exercises/exercise4.py`
5. `./exercises/exercise5.jv` or `./exercises/exercise5.py`

### Exercise Feedback
We provide automated exercise feedback using a GitHub action (that is defined in `.github/workflows/exercise-feedback.yml`). 

To view your exercise feedback, navigate to Actions -> Exercise Feedback in your repository.

The exercise feedback is executed whenever you make a change in files in the `exercise` folder and push your local changes to the repository on GitHub. To see the feedback, open the latest GitHub Action run, open the `exercise-feedback` job and `Exercise Feedback` step. You should see command line output that contains output like this:

```sh
Found exercises/exercise1.jv, executing model...
Found output file airports.sqlite, grading...
